<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Sachin ðŸ‘‹</h1>

#### A little bit about myself
- I am a proactive individual with a predilection for working on cutting edge technology and an inherent thirst for knowledge. Currently I am graduate student pursuing a masters in Financial Mathermatics at NC State University. I wish to puruse my career as a Quantitative Modeller for an Investment bank. Before coming here, I graduated with a degree of M.Sc.(Hons) Economics and B.E(Hons) Civil Engineering from BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. From here I got an opportunity to intern with Credit Suisse. This internship gave me a glimpse into the industry, allowing me to apply my coursework to the daytoday operations of the bank. The lateral thinking approach to the problem was highly recognized by the bank and thus hired me as a Quantitative Risk Analyst. 

- I am seeking an internship opportunity that will not only allow me to grow in a professional capacity and increase my knowledge base, but more importantly also allow me to contribute to an area which is constantly evolving, deeply interesting and extremely cutting edge. You can contact me with the links provided below.


1. I am currently working on Sentiment Analysis for Event Driven Stock Prediction. This project leverages deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict accurate stock price movements based on news headlines, showcasing proficiency in NLP. It involved data engineering skills by using innovative web scraping and data preprocessing techniques to gather, preprocess, and analyze vast amounts of news data, preparing it for use in highly accurate CNN models.
